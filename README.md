# ThreeIntComparison
Program was created with MIPS Assembly 
and is designed to read 3 int values from 
the user. It will then go through a series of tests,
including returning the Sum, Product, Average, Highest value,
and lowest value. This program demonstrates appropriate documentation,
knowledge of register use, and working with floating point values through
assembly.

Program was meant to be a lesson in further understanding of MIPS Assembly structure 
as well as appropriate documentation.
